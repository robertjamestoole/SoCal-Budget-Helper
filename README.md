# SoCal-Budget-Helper
Small thing I wrote in Python to help me as I was moving to see what my total expenses and left over money would be in the end. 
This is the second version as the first did not have a check for inputs other than numbers. 

I also added an input at the end to keep the end result up for evaluation.

There is still more to add, but this does hit a lot of expenses for myself and was a fun tool to help with new living expenses.

Still need to figure out a way to not need to duplicate so much code throughtout the project: maybe classes would help
but I don't know how to use them yet. 

I will update this project little by little as I learn more to make it more clean and concise and learn tools that are more effective.

The end result will be the same for the project and this will always be a budget or expense helper to give someone a better outlook
on their total cost of living in Southern California so they can make the appropriate adjustments to meet their saving goals.

This code can easily be altered to a reasonable rent/mortgage number for your state or area.

An end goal is to use a web scraper to get median rent cost per area that someone is in so that anyone in any area could use this and
it would be as effective in New York as it is in California, but that will be in a future update.

Thanks for taking the time to README and taking a glance at this script. -R
